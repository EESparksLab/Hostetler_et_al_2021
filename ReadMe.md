Data and code associated with Hostetler et al., 2022 manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.14289)

R Input Files (Folder): All csv files required to run R script and analysis. Processed files specifically for Figure generation are located within the sub folder 'Figure Files'

R Scripts (Folder): All script used to process data files, prep for Figure generation, and analyses are included here. Script called 'Hostetler_et_al_FigureScript_Version2_12132021.R' is used to generate Figures (main and supplementary figures) in manuscript (updated 12/15/2021). Script called 'Hostetler_et_al_DataAnalysisScript_Version2_12132021.R' is used to conduct all analysis in updated manuscript. This R script is separated by Headings and Subheadings to match manuscript. Script called 'Hostetler_et_al_DataProcessingScript_Version2_12132021.R' is used to merge files and process raw data. 

Supplementary Data (Folder): All supplementary figures (.pdf) and tables (.xlsx) associated with the Hostetler et al., 2022 manuscript (updated on 02/2022) 

Raw Data (Folder): All raw data (unprocessed) located here. Subfolders for each of the following data types: 1) Biomechanics Data (2018 and 2019), 2) Lodging Data, and 3) Phenotype Data. The Biomechanics subfolder includes all data downloaded from DARLING devices in 2018 and 2019. Within the main Biomechanics Data (2018 and 2019) folder there is an excel (.xlsx) sheet that identifies the meta data for each plot. The Phenotype Data (2019) is labeled by plot. The same meta data file for the Biomechanics data is appropriate for phenotype data.
