Data and code associated with Hostetler et al., 2021 manuscript 

R Input Files (Folder): All csv files required to run R script and analysis. Processed files specifically for Figure generation are located within the sub folder 'Figure Files'

R Scripts (Folder): All script used to process data files, prep for Figure generation, and analyses are included here. Scripts are separated into section by the corresponding subheading from Hostetler et al., 2021. Analyses are ordered in the order they appear in the results section. 

SVDQuartets Files and Log (Folder): Nexus file, Data log, and Tree files needed for the generation of the phylogenetic tree located here. 

Supplementary Data (Folder): All supplementary figures (.pdf) and tables (.xlsx) associated with the Hostetler et al., 2021 manuscript  

Raw Data (Folder): All raw data (unprocessed) located here. Subfolders for each of the following data types: 1) Biomechanics Data (2018 and 2019), 2) Lodging Data, 3) Phenotype Data, and 4) Species Tree Data. The Biomechanics subfolder includes all data downloaded from DARLING devices in 2018 and 2019. Within the main Biomechanics Data (2018 and 2019) folder there is an excel (.xlsx) sheet that identifies the meta data for each plot. The Phenotype Data (2019) is labeled by plot. The same meta data file for the Biomechanics data is appropriate for phenotype data.
